<h1 align = "center">Practice Risk Assessment Tool</h1>
A webapp designed to assist with annual reporting in accordance with Engineers & Geoscientists BC Practice. The original version of the Risk Assessment Matrix appears in Appendix B to the <a href = "https://www.egbc.ca/getmedia/86710280-a428-4035-b596-e495bf36249d/EGBC-Guide-to-the-CEP.pdf">"Guide to the Continuing Education Program" version 4.0</a>. <br>
This tool has been developed independently as an exercise in Python, webapp development, and GitHub processes. This tool is not endorsed by EGBC but I use it in my own practice.<br>
The webapp can be found on <a href= "https://budd2000-practice-risk-assessment-e-risk-assessment-tool-sgrlx5.streamlit.app/"> streamlit </a>.<br>
