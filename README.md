<h1 align = "center">Practice Risk Assessment Tool</h1>
A webapp designed to assist with annual reporting in accordance with Engineers & Geoscientists BC Practice. The original version of this appears in the Appendix to the ["Guide to the Continuing Education Program" version 3.0](https://www.egbc.ca/getmedia/86710280-a428-4035-b596-e495bf36249d/EGBC-Guide-to-the-CEP-V1-0.pdf.aspx). <br>
This tool has been developed independently as an exercise in Python, webapp development, and GitHub processes. This tool is not endorsed by EGBC but I use it in my own practice.<br>
